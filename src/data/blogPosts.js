Social media pages are great for engagement, but they\'re rented space. You don\'t own them, you don\'t control them, and they can change the rules whenever they want.' },

It never sleeps, never takes a day off, and it\'s always ready to tell potential customers exactly who you are and what you do.

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Within three seconds of landing on your website, a visitor should understand exactly what you do, who you do it for, and why they should care. That\'s it. If someone has to scroll around and piece together what your business offers, you\'ve already lost them.' },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'If someone visits your website and doesn\'t immediately know what to do next, they\'ll leave. It sounds harsh, but attention spans are short. Every single page needs a clear, visible call to action. "Call Now," "Get a Free Quote," "Book an Appointment," whatever fits your business, make it impossible to miss.' },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Nothing kills trust faster than a website with last year\'s holiday hours, a disconnected phone number, or a copyright date from 2019. If your website looks abandoned, visitors assume your business might be too. Review your site at least quarterly to keep everything current.' },
      { type: 'callout', text: 'A website with outdated information is worse than no website at all. It actively damages your credibility.' },
      { type: 'heading', text: '3. Slow Load Times' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'We covered this before, but it bears repeating. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, you\'re losing over half your visitors before they even see your content. Run your site through Google PageSpeed Insights and address any critical issues.' },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Pull out your phone right now and look at your website. Is the text readable without zooming? Can you tap buttons easily? Does the navigation work? If not, you\'re frustrating most of your visitors. Google also ranks mobile-unfriendly sites lower in search results.' },

These basics alone can dramatically improve your visibility in local search results.' },
